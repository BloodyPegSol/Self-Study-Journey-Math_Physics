Hi fellas!! I am currently in a journey of self-study with the goal to gain insight into the beauty and structure 
of mathematical proofs and physics, and this is a type of journal for self study. I am posting my answers so that 
other people practicing self-study with the same book can compare answers, learn from another way to solve the same 
problem, get help if they are stuck and promote exchange of ideas through commentary. I am aware I am not flawless 
and I am open to corrections.
